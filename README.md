[![CI](https://github.com/cloudfra/template-go/actions/workflows/deploy.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cloudfra/template-go/actions/workflows/deploy.yaml) [![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/cloudfra/template-go.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cloudfra/template-go) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/cloudfra/template-go/graph/badge.svg?token=UVApxhg6z7)](https://codecov.io/gh/cloudfra/template-go)

A starter template for Go projects at Cloudfra, wiring together a
`make`-based build system, cross-platform binaries, Docker images,
Terraform-based deployment, and CI so new services can skip the
boilerplate and start with working infrastructure on day one.

## Features

- **Cross-compilation** — build binaries for every supported OS/arch
  (Linux, Windows, macOS, BSDs, and more) with a single `make` invocation.
- **Signed release binaries** — `make release-binaries` code-signs the
  artifacts it can (all Windows architectures via Authenticode; only
  `linux/386` and `linux/amd64` via an embedded detached signature) with
  a self-signed cert generated on demand, or your own via
  `CODESIGN_CERT`/`CODESIGN_KEY`. Every other platform is copied unsigned.
- **Docker images** — package any binary defined under `cmd/` into a
  container image, either a quick single-arch build or a full
  multi-arch manifest merging every supported Linux/Windows platform.
- **Protobuf/gRPC support** — `proto.mk` and vendored `google_protobuf`
  and `grpc_gateway` definitions under `third_party/` for services that
  need RPC APIs.
- **Terraform deployment** — infrastructure-as-code under `install/terraform`
  for provisioning test and production environments.
- **CI included** — GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`)
  that builds, lints, and tests on every push and pull request.
- **Enforced linting** — `make lint` runs gofmt/go vet, gofumpt,
  golangci-lint, revive, hadolint, actionlint, govulncheck, and
  tflint/terraform fmt, downloading its own toolchain so it's reproducible
  locally and in CI.

## Getting started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:cloudfra/template-go.git
# Build binaries for every supported platform
make -j$(nproc)
# Build and run the example binary for your current platform
make run
```

## Project layout

```
cmd/<app>/       Entry point(s) for each binary (one directory per app)
internal/        Private application and library code
install/terraform/  Infrastructure-as-code for deploying the app
third_party/     Vendored protobuf/gRPC-gateway definitions
build/           Build outputs (binaries, toolchain) - not checked in
```

To add a new binary, create a new directory under `cmd/` with a `main`
package; the build system picks it up automatically.

## Common make targets

| Target | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `make` / `make all` | Build binaries for every supported platform |
| `make run` | Build and run the example binary |
| `make test` | Run the unit test suite |
| `make bench` | Run benchmarks |
| `make test-deflake` | Re-run tests to catch flakes |
| `make lint` | Run the full lint suite (see Features) |
| `make protos` | Generate code from `.proto` definitions |
| `make docker-images` | Build a quick single-arch (`linux/amd64`) Docker image per app, tagged locally |
| `make scan-images` | Build a local single-arch image per app and scan it with trivy, failing on HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities |
| `make images` | Build every supported Linux/Windows platform and merge them into one multi-arch manifest per app |
| `make linux-images` / `make windows-images` | Build just the Linux or Windows platform images that `make images` merges |
| `make release-binaries` | Build release artifacts for every platform, code-signing where supported (Windows, `linux/386`, `linux/amd64`) |
| `make windows-binaries` | Build Windows binaries only |
| `make tf-test` | Run Terraform tests |
| `make presubmit` | Run the full suite of checks used in CI (tools, lint, build, test-deflake) |
| `make clean` | Remove build outputs |
| `make deps` / `make upgrade-deps` | Install / upgrade Go module dependencies |

## Testing

```bash
make test
make bench
```

## Code signing

`make release-binaries` code-signs the release artifacts under
`build/release/` where signing is supported, and copies everything else
unsigned:

- **Windows** (all architectures) — Authenticode-signed with `osslsigncode`.
- **`linux/386` and `linux/amd64`** — get a detached CMS/PKCS7 signature
  embedded in a `.cloudfra_signature` ELF section via `objcopy`.
- **Everything else** (the remaining Linux architectures — arm, arm64,
  mips\*, ppc\*, riscv64, loong64, s390x — plus darwin and the BSDs) is a
  plain unsigned copy. Debian/Ubuntu's `binutils` package ships `objcopy`
  built with only the x86 BFD backends, so it can't embed a signature
  section into non-x86 ELF binaries (see `LINUX_OBJCOPY_SIGNABLE_PLATFORMS`
  in the `Makefile`).

Both signing paths require `osslsigncode`, `openssl`, and `binutils`
(`objcopy`) to be installed — see the "Install Signing Dependencies" step
in `deploy.yaml` for the packages CI installs.

By default the cert/key pair is generated on demand at
`build/certs/codesign.{crt,key}` using
[`certtool`](https://github.com/cloudfra/certtool) (self-signed, fetched
automatically as part of the toolchain). To sign with your own
certificate instead, point `CODESIGN_CERT`/`CODESIGN_KEY` at existing
files:

```bash
make CODESIGN_CERT=/path/to/cert.pem CODESIGN_KEY=/path/to/key.pem release-binaries
```

## Deployment

Infrastructure is managed with Terraform under `install/terraform`:

```bash
cd install/terraform
terraform init
terraform plan -var=gcp_project_id=<your-project-id> -var=testing=true
terraform apply -var=gcp_project_id=<your-project-id> -var=testing=true
```

## GitHub repository setup

`scripts/configure-github-repo.sh` applies the GitHub repository settings
this template expects (branch cleanup on merge, auto-merge, Dependabot
alerts/security updates, secret scanning, branch protection on `main`,
etc.), so a repo created from this template can be brought in line with
one command instead of clicking through Settings by hand. It infers
`OWNER/REPO` from the `origin` remote, so it's enough to just run:

```bash
scripts/configure-github-repo.sh
```

Pass `--repo OWNER/REPO` to target a different repository instead, or
`--dry-run` to print what it would change without touching anything.

It's idempotent, and settings unavailable on a given plan (e.g. branch
protection or secret scanning on a private repo without GitHub Advanced
Security) are skipped with a warning rather than failing the run.
